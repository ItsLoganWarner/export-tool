# Exportomation

A tool that aims to make editing and quickly applying presets to Automation to BeamNG exports much easier and efficient.

## Features
- Visual editor for general engine, exhaust, afterfire, and forced-induction params. More coming soon.
- Built-in Presets
- - Pre-loaded presets created by either myself or members of the community that can be useful for quick changes to exports
- Custom Presets
- - Create and Save your own custom presets so you can apply them to future exports in just a few clicks.
- Combine Presets
- - Both Built-In and Custom User Presets can be continuously stacked and combined via the '+' button
- One-click apply changes to jbeam files

## Known Bugs/Flaws
 - Currently only works on unzipped exports. In the future I hope to add support for zipped.
 - Twincharged engine forced induction values cannot currently be edited, due to the nuances of my current parsing implementation.
